This repository was made as an example of  mlx graphic library compilation and project structure on Linux system.

Makefile compiles two different mlx libraries (sources/minilibx, sources/minilibx_macosx) depending on a host system.

Flags for project compilation may be found in the Makefile in the repository root folder.

#minilibx_macosx original cmake files were changed because of a build problem.
